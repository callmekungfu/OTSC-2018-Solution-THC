# The Huton Collection By Yong Lin Wang.
This is my solution to the 2018 Ontario Skills Competition Website Development Challenge. It is also the silver medal winning solution. Feel free to fork or download this code and make it your own! I will add more inline documentation along the way. You can preview the website here: [Click Me](http://www.yonglinwang.ca/huton).

# Set up
If you are gonna go to OTSC, you should at least know how to copy code from somewhere online, like GitHub. However, if you have never used tools like GitHub, or setup Apache, MySQL or phpMyAdmin before, here is a short list of procedures:
1. Either clone or download the repository by clicking the `Clone or Download` button, and save the files to the `htdocs` folder if you are using XAMPP.
2. If you are using anything other than XAMPP, simply but the files in whichever folder that servers `public_html`.
3. Go to phpmyadmin if you have it, then create a database called `thehutoncollection`, and use the builtin import utility to import the database with the `thehutoncollection.sql` file.
4. You are done! Run localhost and you should see a preview of the website!
